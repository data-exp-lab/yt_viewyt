# YTView #
YT currently stands as one of the only, if not the most, effective means of data visualization in the astrophysical community, but there is always room for improvement. This repository is an investigation into the viability of a graphical implementation of YT; executing the script it contains on a local data set provides a brief glimpse at very basic features such an implementation would provide. Emphasis in this project is placed on intuitive interaction with data: minimizing scripting maximizes analysis and provides broader audiences with the ability to interact with the data in question. Please give it a try and report back your experience in the link below.
