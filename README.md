# YTView #
YT currently stands as one of the only, if not the most, effective means of data visualization in the astrophysical community, but there is always room for improvement. This repository contains an application with a large number of interactive features built on yt, and provides a solid foundation for further additions. 



# Dependencies #
In addition to YT, this application requires PyQt, Sips, and obviously yt and all of its dependencies. 

# Demo Execution #
To run simply input "/path/to/clone/view_yt/viewyt.py"
